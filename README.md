# etch-a-sketch

This project is "drawing from pixels" or in this case divs, I created a createGrid function which passes a number from an input or uses its default(16). It will create a div will class *grid* and append it to container.

Using createGrid function has two for loops which create *grid* class and *grid-style*, the second being the color that is be over written to.
