# etch-a-sketch

This project involves creating a "drawing from pixels" effect using divs instead of actual pixels. To achieve this, I developed a createGrid function that takes a number from an input or uses a default value of 16. This function creates a div with the class grid and appends it to a container.

To create the grid class and grid-style class, the createGrid function utilizes two for loops. The first loop creates the grid class, while the second loop defines the color that will be overwritten.
